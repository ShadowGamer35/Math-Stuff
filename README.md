# Math-Stuff
 This is a program with various calculators ranging from basic to moderately interesting.

## Required libraries.

You have to install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) for `MathStuff_GUI.py` and `GUICreator.py` to work.

## How to use.

`MathStuff.py` is the main program where all the calculators are kept as functions.

`using_MathStuff.py` calls each function in `MathStuff.py` to show how they work/test functionality.

`MathStuff_GUI.py` provides a graphical interface for using the calculators, though introduces more restrictions than calling the functions.

`GUICreator.py` has different classes for easily making pygame GUI, used extensively in `MathStuff_GUI.py`.

`program_info.txt` provides information on how the programs work.
